# Xiami_To_Spotify


## introduction:
    this is a project in purpose to enable user to transfer music from [Xiami](http://www.xiami.com) to [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/)
    the music this application grading is from ** Xiami -> my music 我的音乐** to ** Spotify -> playlist -> From_Xiami (we create for you)**

        - [ ] after you successfully create an application, you will see Client_id and Client_Secret, keep these two information
        - [ ] You will also see Redirect URIs after it, in there Paste [](http://github.com/zhang435/Xiami_To_Spotify/) and click add
